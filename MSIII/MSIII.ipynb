A brief summary is below, but the MSII_Base_Orbit_Determination_corrected.ipynb and MSII_corrected.ipynb files can be consulted for more specific details about the implementation.\n",
    "- Used maximum latitude instead of average (see Formula_Sheet.py)\n",
    "- Changed max resolution to 3.99m (see MSIII_useful_consts.py)\n",
    "- Added visits-per-day metric (see MSIII_Constellation.py)\n",
    "- Used visits-per-day as metric for orbit template (MSII_Base_Orbit_Determination_corrected.ipynb)\n",
    "    - This changed period to 2h and altered COEs significantly\n",
    "- Forced the cheapest camera for budget reasons (see MSIII_Components.py)\n",
    "    - This allowed cheaper structure and possibly changed ADCS\n",
    "- Recomputed constraints to ensure they are met (se MSII_corrected.ipynb)\n",

Perhaps this was not the most reliable metric, but we will be sticking with it at this point to reduce design complexity. Possible reasons why this visitation number might have gone up include the potential for a point to briefly exit and then re-enter the swath width at perigee, thus counting two visitations. This is unclear, but will not be investigated further. A better metric to avoid this issue may have been to calculate the average squared duration between visits (squared so that longer waits would be penalized more heavily) and minimize that number. \n",
