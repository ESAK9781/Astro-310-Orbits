    "\n",
    "We want most of our COEs to be figured out before we start messing with payloads. Realistically, the only COEs that depend on payload are semimajor axis and eccentricity, because we want to fly over at a height where our sensor can see the points. If we pick a reasonable semimajor axis, we can even constrain it to just changing eccentricity to accomodate payloads, because with that can exert enough control on height on approach to see what we want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are our constraints for this?\n",
    "We came up with several constraints for our orbital template:\n",
    "- Approach: We want to approach from apogee, because otherwise we will zoom past it and spend so little time over target that we will have almost no coverage.\n",
    "- Semimajor Axis: We want to keep the semimajor axis small enough that most cameras will be able to modify eccentricity so that apogee is in a vision range to meet our target resolution.\n",
    "- Nice Period: We want our period to be a nice multiple of our 24 hour days. Otherwise, the position of the satellite on its ground track is different each time it comes around because the Earth has rotated under it. This is bad because it makes our math nasty and our coverage erratic or unpredictable.\n",

    "One issue that we can and will need to mitigate, though, is that in perigee (unlike in apogee), we reach the closest point to Earth at the exact moment of perigee. This means that we cannot set the perigee altitude to the exact camera range, because then the single point at which the satellite will be in range is the exact moment of perigee. We want to be able to take more than just one photo per orbit, so we will have to set perigee altitude lower than camera range in hopes of being able to see the target from points around perigee, not just at perigee. This is not an exact science the way we implement it (we are just guessing altitude offsets), but a more precise answer could be developed by looping over many eccentricity values, testing them for coverage, and picking whichever one maximizes that while still adhering to the constraints. However, this drastically increases the number of coverage computations we need to make, each of which is very expensive. For this reason, we will not be doing that."

    "### We have a winner!\n",
    "Really, this is not a very good winner. With this winner, we only get coverage .18% of the time, which is not what we were hoping for. However, this includes at least 3 short daily viewing sessions each day, because all three satellites will fly over the points at times evenly spaced throughout the day. If the enemy is up to something, we will see it within at most (24/3=8) hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some might be wondering why we did not just use an orbit that stays at the target altitude for its entire orbit (circular). There is a very good reason for this. Were we to do this, we would get a period which is does not devide envenly into 24 hours. This means that, every day, the orbit ground track would shift just the smallest bit on the face of the Earth, because -- while the satellite is returning to the same coordinates -- it is doing so at a time when the Earth is rotated in a different position. It is certainly true that we would have comparable coverage for our first orbit, but the phase shift would gradually become worse and worse until we were looking at some random point in the middle of one of Earth's oceans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there is the concern that, by staying ~600 km (our mission altitude) in altitude for the entire lifetime of the satellite, we would experience much greater drag, lowering the lifespan. We could also experience far more significant wear and tear from colliding with oxygen in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. This is not good, so it is better to use this highly elliptical orbit.\n",
