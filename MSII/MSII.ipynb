    "The Design Project Cadet Handout allows for \"a spreadsheet, computer program (e.g., MatLab) or hand calculations to support your analysis,\" provided that your final submission is \"formatted in such a way that the instructor can see the formulas you are using and the final answers.\" Python is a computational tool of a very similar caliber to MatLab (in the hands of an experienced user), and is thus authorized. A brief in-class discussion with Gen. Thompson confirmed this.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have, to this end, written a fairly comprehensive software library which is capable of computing, among other things, the percent coverage, budget calculations, orbit positions by time, viability assessments, and many other rudimentary computations of a given constellation. The exact code used for the entire project will be included in the submission, as well as a condensed version with the exact formulas we used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understand that the code in this notebook will be extremely abstracted and surface level because it relies on the software library (entirely written by me) for all the computations that would truly be considered Astro-related.\n",
